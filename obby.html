  <h1 class="obby">what is a obby</h1>
  <p>An Obby is an obstacle course (or a parkour course), in which the Player
    must come across and overcome a series of obstacles to complete the game. The Obstacle 
    courses include checkpoints at each stage or level. They are common in Roblox and a 
    lot of fun!</p>

  <h2>why is it called a obby?</h2>
  <p>
    Obby means obstacle course it came from the first military groups on roblox like FEAR. 
    Obby basically is just a nickname for a obstacle course. Obby is just short for 
    Obstacle Course. It's hard to say when it started being shortened to Obby, but I 
    can totally see why it became common to shorten it. The thing is that these games 
    were popular on Roblox very early on (2007-2009), and Parkour itself didn't really become 
    popular until 2010ish.</p>

    <h3>is it hard</h3>
    <p>The obby challenge is easy and hard at the same time. Use your superior gaming 
        skills to glide through the super amazing fun levels and have the experience of a 
        lifetime. Be careful though, all this abundance of fun will come at a cost.</p>
