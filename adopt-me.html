        Adopt Me can be an enjoyable game on Roblox. You can use it for roleplaying, 
        building, designing, and trading in-game items. However, Adopt Me players can 
        be pros or new players. A lot of new players don't really know how to play and 
        need a little guidance. Adopt Me! is a massive multiplayer online game on the 
        gaming platform Roblox. The original focus of the game was to adopt children. 
        The game was developed further, and its focus is now on collecting pets. Adopt Me!

            <h4>what are the very first pets</h4>
            <p>The Dog and the Cat are the only pets that can be hatched from the Starter 
              Egg. Since the egg cannot be traded, it cannot be obtained anywhere else in 
              the game if the player already hatched it. Players have to be playing in the 
              adult role to obtain and take care of the Starter Egg.</p>
